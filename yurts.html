  <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
      Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof
      dome that can be opened.</dd>

    <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired
      stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with
      hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in
      the lodge.</dd>

    <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
      weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight
      and a sense of adventure!</dd>
